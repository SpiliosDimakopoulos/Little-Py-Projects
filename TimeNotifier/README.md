# Reminder System - README

## Overview

This Python-based reminder system allows users to schedule and receive notifications for various reminders at specific times throughout the day. The system utilizes the `schedule` library for scheduling tasks and the `plyer` library to send desktop notifications.

## Features

- **Set Reminders**: Schedule reminders with custom messages and times.
- **Notifications**: Receive desktop notifications at the scheduled times.
- **Customizable**: Set as many reminders as you need with different messages and times.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `schedule` library for scheduling reminders
- `plyer` library for sending notifications

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install schedule plyer
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python reminder_system.py
    ```

## Usage

Upon running the script, the system will automatically send notifications for the reminders you set. To set a reminder, you can modify the `set_reminder()` function calls in the script.

### Example Usage

- To set a reminder for a meeting at 2:30 PM:

    ```python
    set_reminder("Meeting with the team", "14:30")
    ```

- To set a reminder for a break at 4:00 PM:

    ```python
    set_reminder("Take a break", "16:00")
    ```

### Notification Example

Once the reminder time arrives, you will receive a desktop notification with the message you set.

## How It Works

1. **Setting a Reminder**: The `set_reminder()` function schedules a reminder using the `schedule` library and triggers the `send_reminder()` function to display a notification at the specified time.
2. **Running the Script**: The `while` loop continuously checks for pending tasks and sends notifications when it's time.
