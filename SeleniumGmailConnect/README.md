# Gmail Login Automation - README

## Overview

This Python script automates the process of logging into a Gmail account using Selenium WebDriver. It opens the Gmail login page, enters the provided email credentials, and attempts to log in. 

### **Important Note**
This script may not work for most users due to Google's strict security policies, especially if:
- Multiple Gmail accounts are created from the same IP, app, or device.
- Google's "This browser or app may not be secure" restriction is triggered.

Using this script may result in account suspension or CAPTCHA challenges due to automated login detection.

## Features

- Automates Gmail login via Selenium WebDriver.
- Simple implementation with customizable email and password inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver compatible with the installed Chrome version
- Selenium library

## Installation

1. Install the Selenium library:

    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```

2. Download and install ChromeDriver:
   - Ensure the ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version.
   - Download it from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).

3. Place the ChromeDriver executable in your system's PATH or specify its location in the `chromedriver_path` variable.

## Usage

1. **Edit the Script**:
   - Replace the placeholders with your email credentials:
     ```python
     gmailId = 'your-email@gmail.com'
     passWord = 'your-password'
     chromedriver_path = 'path-to-your-chromedriver'
     ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python gmail_login.py
     ```

3. **Expected Outcome**:
   - If successful, you will see a message:
     ```
     Login Successful...!!
     ```
   - If login fails, the error will be printed:
     ```
     Login Failed: [Error details]
     ```

## Limitations and Risks

- **Security Restrictions**: Google's security policies may block automated logins and flag your account.
- **Privacy Risk**: Storing plain-text credentials is unsafe. Use secure methods to store sensitive data.
- **CAPTCHA and Multi-Factor Authentication**: The script does not handle CAPTCHA challenges or accounts with MFA enabled.
